# Pass some extra options to rustc, some of which get passed on to the linker.
#
# * linker argument --nmagic turns off page alignment of sections (which saves
#   flash space)
# * linker argument -Tlink.x tells the linker to use link.x as the linker
#   script. This is usually provided by the cortex-m-rt crate, and by default
#   the version in that crate will include a file called `memory.x` which
#   describes the particular memory layout for your specific chip. 
# * inline-threshold=5 makes the compiler more aggressive and inlining functions
# * no-vectorize-loops turns off the loop vectorizer (seeing as the M0+ doesn't
#   have SIMD)
